This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project solving the solidity challenge (https://github.com/exactly/solidity-challenge), which I transformed into somekind of ETH Pool marketplace.

## Contract Details

Contract deployed on Euthereum Sepolia Test Network and verified on Etherscan: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/

Contract: 0x57F5a2cF6127240257c953E2237f52e2F17E62a5

Many more features to come in the future: stay tuned!

## Overview

Project has dependencies on multiple technologies.

- [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/) - store images, and ETH Pool metadata
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) - private Blockchain, to run application localy

## How To

1. Clone the repository code.

2. cd to the root directory of the project and run npm install.

3. Configure the .env.development or .env.production file properly.

4. Since we are deploying the demo on Sepolia Test Network, make sure you register for one and configure the file keys.json properly.

5. I used Ganache to test the smart contracts locally: therefore remember to link truffle with your Ganache.

6. While at the root directory of the project, use truffle to migrate and deploy the smart contracts on the Sepolia Test Network of the Ethereum blockchain.

7. Then, use npm build to build the app.

8. Finally, deploy the app and start enjoying your ETH Pool marketplace.
